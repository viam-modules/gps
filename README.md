# [`gps` module](https://github.com/viam-modules/gps)

This [gps module](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/gps) implements the gps [rtk-serial](#Configure-your-rtk-serial-movement_sensor), rtk-pmtk, nmea, and rtk-dual-gps movement sensors using the [`rdk:component:movement_sensor` API](https://docs.viam.com/appendix/apis/components/movement_sensor/).

A global positioning system (GPS) receives signals from satellites in the earthâ€™s orbit to determine where it is and how fast it is going.

The `rtk-serial` and [`rtk-pmtk`](https://docs.viam.com/components/movement-sensor/gps-nmea-rtk-pmtk/) movement sensor models support [NTRIP-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networked_Transport_of_RTCM_via_Internet_Protocol) [real time kinematic positioning (RTK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning) GPS units ([such as these](https://www.sparkfun.com/rtk)) and RTCM versions up to 3.3.

The chip requires a correction source to get to the required positional accuracy.
The `rtk-serial` model uses an over-the-internet correction source like an RTK reference station and sends the data over a serial connection to the [board](https://docs.viam.com/components/board/).

Follow the guide to [Set up a SparkFun RTK Reference Station](https:docs.viam.com/components/movement-sensor/set-up-base-station/) to configure a SparkFun station for use with this RTK-enabled GPS movement sensor model.

## Configure your rtk-serial movement_sensor

> [!NOTE]
> Before configuring your movement_sensor, you must [create a machine](https://docs.viam.com/cloud/machines/#add-a-new-machine).

Navigate to the [**CONFIGURE** tab](https://docs.viam.com/configure/) of your [machine](https://docs.viam.com/fleet/machines/) in the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com/).
[Add movement_sensor / gps:MODEL to your machine](https://docs.viam.com/configure/#components).

On the new component panel, copy and paste the following attribute template into your movement_sensor's attributes field:

```json
{
  "serial_path": "<path_to_serial_port>",
  "serial_baud_rate": <int>,
  "ntrip_connect_attempts": <int>,
  "ntrip_mountpoint": "<identifier>",
  "ntrip_password": "<password for NTRIP server>",
  "ntrip_url": "<URL of NTRIP server>",
  "ntrip_username": "<username for NTRIP server>"
}
```

### Attributes

The following attributes are available for `viam:gps:rtk-serial` movement_sensors:

| Attribute | Type | Required? | Description |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | ----------  |
| `serial_path`            | string | **Required** | The full filesystem path to the serial device, starting with <file>/dev/</file>. To find your serial device path, first connect the serial device to your machine, then:<ul><li>On Linux, run <code>ls /dev/serial/by-path/\*</code> to show connected serial devices, or look for your device in the output of <code>sudo dmesg \| grep tty</code>. Example: <code>"/dev/serial/by-path/usb-0:1.1:1.0"</code>.</li><li>On macOS, run <code>ls /dev/tty\* \| grep -i usb</code> to show connected USB serial devices, <code>ls /dev/tty\*</code> to browse all devices, or look for your device in the output of <code>sudo dmesg \| grep tty</code>. Example: <code>"/dev/ttyS0"</code>.</li></ul> |
| `serial_baud_rate`       | int    | Optional     | The rate at which data is sent from the sensor. <br> Default: `38400` |
| `ntrip_url`              | string | **Required** | The URL of the NTRIP server from which you get correction data. Connects to a base station (maintained by a third party) for RTK corrections. |
| `ntrip_username`         | string | Optional     | Username for the NTRIP server. |
| `ntrip_password`         | string | Optional     | Password for the NTRIP server. |
| `ntrip_connect_attempts` | int    | Optional     | How many times to attempt connection before timing out. <br> Default: `10` |
| `ntrip_mountpoint`       | string | Optional     | If you know of an RTK mountpoint near you, write its identifier here. It will be appended to NTRIP address string (for example, "nysnet.gov/rtcm/**NJMTPT1**") and that mountpoint's data will be used for corrections. |

## Example configuration

### `viam:gps:rtk-serial`
```json
  {
      "name": "<your-gps-rtk-serial-movement_sensor-name>",
      "model": "viam:gps:rtk-serial",
      "type": "movement_sensor",
      "namespace": "rdk",
      "attributes": {
        "serial_path": "/dev/serial/by-path/usb-0:1.1:1.0",
        "serial_baud_rate": 115200,
        "ntrip_connect_attempts": 12,
        "ntrip_mountpoint": "MNTPT",
        "ntrip_password": "pass",
        "ntrip_url": "http://ntrip/url",
        "ntrip_username": "usr"
      },
      "depends_on": []
  }
```

The `"serial_path"` filepath used in this example is specific to serial devices connected to Linux systems.
The `"serial_path"` filepath on a macOS system might resemble <file>"/dev/ttyUSB0"</file> or <file>"/dev/ttyS0"</file>.

> [!NOTE]
> How you connect your device to an NTRIP server varies by geographic region.
You will need to research the options available to you.
